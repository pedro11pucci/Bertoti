We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play.   On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth.

Within Google, we sometimes say, “Software engineering is programming integrated over time.” Programming  is certainly a significant part of software engineering: after all, programming is how you generate new software in the first place. If you accept this distinction, it also becomes clear that we might need to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance). The addition of time adds an important new dimension to programming. Cubes aren’t squares, distance isn’t velocity. Software engineering isn’t programming.


What is Software Engineering?: Software engineering is different from programming in the sense that programming is the creation of new codes; this goes into the cleanness of the code, optimization, best practices and much more, but software engineering is when the professional has to think about different aspects, like the scalability of the software and other different long-term aspects. In short, software engineering is programming with time, scale and trade-offs.

What are requisites?: Requisites are necessites from the client that will dictate how the software engineer creates the software. They are separated in two categores: Functional requisites and non-functional requisites. Functional requisites are features that the software has to have, for instance, a messenger app needs to be able to message other people; a non-functional requisite is a quality of the software, for instance, the messenger app needs to have a fast performance.
